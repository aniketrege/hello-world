Hello!

This is a brief personal introduction to me, Aniket. 

I'm currently a student at the National Institute of Technology-Karnataka, India pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE). A strong love for anything with buttons as an infant, as well as video games throughout my childhood (and way up until now) cultivated a strong sense of personal curiosity in how the technology our daily lives run on works. My core ECE interests include Signal Processing, Embedded Systems, and Communcation Systems.

Since joining college, interactions with my peers have led to further interest in web development, including forays into Bootstrap, CSS3, JS, and Django, and hopefully in the near future to more advanced sessions in WebGl and Ruby.

Currently in the process of learning the basics of databasing through the wonders of SQLite3, NoSQL and SQLAlchemy, as well as developing an advanced foundation in Python and Java.

I write this in Jan '16 as much a red faced newb as possible, and hope to look back on this in a few months and years and have a good laugh.

Enjoy your day, and happy coding!

-Aniket
